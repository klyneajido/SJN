# CPU Scheduling Algorithms Project

This project simulates the Shortest Job Next (SJN) CPU scheduling algorithm. The Gantt chart visualization helps illustrate the scheduling of processes based on their arrival and burst times.

## Setting up:

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
[git clone <repository-url>](https://github.com/klyneajido/SJN.git)
```

### 2. Navigate into the project directory:
```bash
cd shortest-job-next
```

### 3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Install additional dependencies if needed:
- **Bootstrap** for styling:
```bash
npm install bootstrap
```
- **Font Awesome** for icons:
```bash
npm install @fortawesome/fontawesome-free
```

### 5. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 6. Open the app in your browser:
The app should now be accessible at `http://localhost:5173/`.

## Additional Notes:
- Ensure that you have `Node.js` and `npm` installed on your machine before setting up the project.
- Custom styling is done using both Bootstrap classes and CSS modules.
